# NYC-Taxi-trip-duration
A typical taxi company faces a common problem of efficiently assigning the cabs to passengers so that the service is smooth and hassle free. One of main issue is determining the duration of the current trip so it can predict when the cab will be free for the next trip.
In order to analyse the trend in the trip durations of taxi rides in New York City, I picked the data set from Kaggle. The challenge here is to build a model to predict the trip durations of taxi rides in New York City using the analysis done in R. The ability to predict taxi ridership could present valuable insights to city planners and taxi dispatchers in answering questions such as how to position cabs where they are most needed, how many taxis to dispatch, and how ridership varies over time really interested me to do the project.
The dataset contains 1.5 million training observations and 630k test observations. The dataset contains information like the vendor id and passenger count. And other trip details like the pick-up and drop off date time details, latitude and longitude details and trip duration in seconds. Where I have considered trip duration as the target variable.
